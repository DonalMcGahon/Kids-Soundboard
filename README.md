# Kids-Soundboard

### Mobile Applications Project

Create a Universal Windows Project (UWP) that will each demonstrate the use of Isolated Storage
and at least one other sensor or service available on the devices. These include:
- Accelerometer or Gyroscope
- GPS (Location Based Services)
- Sound
- Network Services (connecting to server for data updates etc)
- Camera
- Multi Touch Gesture Management

### Functionality
+ The app I made is a children's soundboard and spelling test app. The user is greeted with the opening log in page. The user can register with the app and return to the log in page with the details they just used to register.

+ Once the user is in they will see a Home page with a Begin button to press when they wish to begin. Once they do they will have mulitple images that they can press to play built in sounds. The user can try and spell what is in the images and if spelt correctly or incorrectly a popup will appear to let them know.
